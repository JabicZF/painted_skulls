# painted_skulls
A small datapack that lets you paint wither skeleton skulls into skeleton skulls

With a Brush and some Light Grey Dye, you can now paint Wither Skeleton Skulls into Skeleton Skulls ! 
This one small change makes Skeleton skulls much more obtainable.
As of 1.20, this recipe still consumes an entire brush. I'm working on figuring out to make that NOT happen.
